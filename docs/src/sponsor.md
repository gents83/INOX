I'm Mauro Gentile aka **GENTS**.

I work in videogame industry since a long time and on several differenti projects but in September 2020 I decided in my spare time to learn Rust programming language and quickly I become a real rustucean.
I decided to use Rust and I also wanted to use all my personal knowledge to write a new Game Engine from scratch in Rust on my own (but contributions could be an option to consider)

Working on SABI is really absorbing me a lot of energies and it would be awesome to get some contributions to continue to push it forward and accomplish its vision.
