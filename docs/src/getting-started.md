## How to setup _**Blender**_ add-on

Every time that the code is updated a new version of the add-on is built and uploaded to the repository.
You can download latest version directly from [here](https://github.com/gents83/NRG/raw/gh-pages/NRG.zip)

Once that you downloaded it, you've to extract it in your _**Blender**_ add-on folder.
Usually the path is something like [Blender folder]/[version]/[scripts]/[addon]/

Once extracted you should have now an NRG folder inside your add-on folder:

This step is mainly available to allow users to have __**NRG**__ binaries in a different folder, if needed (as example for the one working directly in code could be useful to set it to build output directory).
